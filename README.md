# 🚌 Bus Tracker System

A web-based Bus Tracker System that helps passengers find buses based on **From Stop, To Stop, and Current Time**, and allows drivers to manage trips and route stops efficiently.

This project focuses on solving real-world public transport problems using a simple and scalable web application.

## 🔍 How Bus Search Works

1. Passenger enters **From Stop**, **To Stop**, and **Current Time**
2. System checks:
   - Both stops exist in the same trip
   - Bus has **not yet passed** the boarding stop
   - Boarding stop comes **before** destination stop
3. Valid buses are displayed with:
   - Bus name
   - Route number
   - Arrival time at boarding stop
   - Trip status
